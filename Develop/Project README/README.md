### PROJECT DESCRIPTION

A good README file for a project describes the goal of the project, essential elements, what the project requirements are, and links to the project repository.  Sometimes it is hard to remember what elements go into a README so a generator is a useful tool to allow developers to create a REAMDE from a generator that asks for the needed information about a project.
